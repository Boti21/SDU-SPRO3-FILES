\section{Physical}

    The infrared sensor array works by the following principles:
    A phototransistor changes its resistance based on the amount of IR light it detects.
    The change in resistance manifests as a voltage between the corresponging "D" pin and ground.
    A togglable IR led can increase the amount of IR light present in the area. By pulling the IR
    pin high the led will be on.

\section{Programming}

    To utilize the IR sensor the program should use an analog to digital converter (ADC) to measure
    each voltage on each "D" pin. By analyzing the values of these, the program can collect information
    on the IR reflectance of the materials the sensor is facing.
