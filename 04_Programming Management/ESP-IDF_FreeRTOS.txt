/* Some commands and code from https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.3/esp32/api-reference/system/freertos.html#:~:text=vTaskDelay()%20specifies%20a%20time,after%20vTaskDelay()%20is%20called.

If you want to print the usual printf() will not work.
Instead create a variable inside your task (only needs to be done once per task):
char* task_name = pcTaskGetName(NULL);

Whenever you want to print something use:
ESP_LOGI(task_name, "The string you want to print\n");


If a delay is needed use:
vTaskDelay(Number_of_millisecond / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
This is not a good solution for periodic tasks, consult the documentation to learn more.
